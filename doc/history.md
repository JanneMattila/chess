# History

My Chess dates back to 2009 when cloud and
serverless was not a thing yet. Read the
first blog post about it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/jannemattila/my-chess-another-chess-application). (**Note**: Board was incorrectly implemented in the first screenshots ðŸ¤£).
It was written in C++ and it ran on Windows and [Windows Mobile 5.0 for Pocket PC Phone Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Mobile#Smartphones).

After that My Chess has been re-written multiple times:

- [Windows Phone 7.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone_7) ([Nokia Lumia 800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_800) era)
- [Windows Phone 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone_8)
- [Windows Phone 8.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone_8.1)
- [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Windows_Platform_apps) Universal Windows Platform app
