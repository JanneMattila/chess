My Chess dates back to 2009 when cloud and
serverless was not a thing yet. Read the

Originally backend was using [Azure Cloud Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-choose-me)
and then it was migrated to Azure Websites which was later branded as [Azure App Servce](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview).

Fun fact: Apparently those times bundling external DLLs was thing:
